# Exception-Handling-Pick-A-Dish
Pick a Dish activity for Exception Handling roundtable

## Activity Instructions
Fork and clone this repository then open the project in VSCode. 

Run the code in `main.py`. Are there other errors that you can cause to happen?
Hint: try a variety of inputs

Are there other behaviors that may not cause an error but are unexpected?
Hint: shouldn't there be two ways that a list index can be out of range?

After exploring the code in `main.py` make the code more error resilient. Consider catching additional errors in `your_menu`.

Consult the Python documentation about [exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions) or any other resources you find helpful for how how to do this.

Consider adding additional checks to `select_dish` and raise your own error.

Reminder: we are not writing tests for this code, we are practicing raising and handling errors.

Feel free to change the menu to be more to your liking!
